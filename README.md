create-thumbnail PATH [--width=WIDTH | --height=HEIGHT] --out-dir=OUT_DIR

focusing on a small piece of code makes it better

"DRY" / rule of three / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)
good at doing inside a single project
but not across project
this is thumbnailing code that I've written across at least half a dozen projects
but it's always an adjunct to the main rpoject
never made it a project on its own so it's always a slightly rushed, half-baked bit of code
pul it out into its own project!

thumbnails = don't feel need in local dev, cos everything is whizzy fast
much better here
